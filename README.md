# Mini Job Portal App (Flutter)

Implements the required interview task:

## Features
- Email + Password authentication (local only, using Hive) with sign up & login.
- Job list fetched from `https://dummyjson.com/products` (API items interpreted as job postings; product titles are replaced with curated job role titles e.g. Junior Software Engineer, SQL Analyst, CEO, etc.).
- Each job card shows: Role, Company, Location, Salary and an Apply button.
- Apply button saves (persists) the job locally (idempotent) – cannot unapply (aligns with interview spec: save when user clicks Apply).
- Detail screen shows full info, synthesized responsibilities & Apply button (disabled once applied).
- Saved (Applied) Jobs tab reading from local Hive box.
- Profile tab with dummy name, email of logged-in user, total applied jobs.

## Project Structure
```
lib/
  models/       # Data models
  services/     # Remote API services
  providers/    # State management (Provider)
  screens/      # UI Screens (auth, home tabs, details)
  widgets/      # (Reserved for reusable widgets)
```

## Running
Ensure Flutter SDK installed.

Install dependencies and run the app:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Building APK
```
flutter build apk --release
```
APK will be at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

### Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)
A workflow (`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) builds the APK on pushes / PRs to `main` / `master` and uploads it as an artifact.

Manual trigger:
1. Go to Actions tab > Build APK > Run workflow.
2. After it completes, download `app-release-apk` artifact.

To add a status badge (after first run), put near the top of this README:
```
![Build APK](https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/<YOUR_REPO>/actions/workflows/build-apk.yml/badge.svg)
```

Signed APK (optional): create repository secrets:
- `KEYSTORE_BASE64` – base64 of your `.jks`
- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` – keystore password
- `KEY_ALIAS` – key alias
- `KEY_PASSWORD` – key password

Then uncomment the signing steps in the workflow.

### Publishing a Release (Tag Build)
Push a semantic tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to trigger `release.yml` which builds:
- Release APK (`app-release.apk`)
- Release App Bundle (`app-release.aab` – Play Store format)
and attaches both to a GitHub Release with autogenerated notes.

Steps:
```
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
Or run the workflow manually (workflow_dispatch) from the Actions tab.

To enable signing for releases, add the same keystore secrets used for the build-apk workflow.

## Assumptions
- Location not provided by API; using static 'Remote'.
- Salary derived: `price * 1000` for demonstration.
- Responsibilities are synthesized deterministically from templates (demo purpose).
- Items from API are repurposed as jobs (since endpoint provides products data only).
- Applying is a one-time action; jobs remain saved (no unapply per requirements wording).
- No password reset / validation email flows (out of scope).

## Next Improvements (Not required)
- Real backend auth / Firebase.
- Search & filters.
- Pagination / infinite scroll.
- Theming & dark mode.
- Unit tests for providers & persistence.
